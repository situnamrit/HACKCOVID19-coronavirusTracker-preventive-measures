A pdf resource from John Hokins University speaks out of the following information

"""In December, 2019, a local outbreak of
pneumonia of initially unknown cause
was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China),
and was quickly determined to be
caused by a novel coronavirus,1
 namely
severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The
outbreak has since spread to every
province of mainland China as well as
27 other countries and regions, with
more than 70 000 confirmed cases as
of Feb 17, 2020.2
 In response to this
ongoing public health emergency,
we developed an online interactive
dashboard, hosted by the Center for
Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, MD, USA, to visualise and
track reported cases of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) in real time.
The dashboard, first shared publicly
on Jan 22, illustrates the location and
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases,
deaths, and recoveries for all affected
countries. It was developed to provide
researchers, public health authorities,
and the general public with a userfriendly tool to track the outbreak
as it unfolds. All data collected and
displayed are made freely available,
initially through Google Sheets and
now through a GitHub repository,
along with the feature layers of the
dashboard, which are now included in
the Esri Living Atlas.
The dashboard reports cases at the
province level in China; at the city level
in the USA, Australia, and Canada;
and at the country level otherwise.
During Jan 22–31, all data collection
and processing were done manually,
and updates were typically done twice
a day, morning and night (US Eastern
Time). As the outbreak evolved, the
manual reporting process became
unsustainable; therefore, on Feb 1,
we adopted a semi-automated living
data stream strategy. Our primary data
source is DXY, an online platform run
by members of the Chinese medical
community, which aggregates local
media and government reports to
provide cumulative totals of COVID-19
cases in near real time at the province
level in China and at the country
level otherwise. Every 15 min, the
cumulative case counts are updated
from DXY for all provinces in China
and for other affected countries and
regions. For countries and regions
outside mainland China (including
Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), we
found DXY cumulative case counts to
frequently lag behind other sources;
we therefore manually update these
case numbers throughout the day
when new cases are identified. To
identify new cases, we monitor
various Twitter feeds, online news
services, and direct communication
sent through the dashboard. Before
manually updating the dashboard,
we confirm the case numbers with
regional and local health departments,

So, the data set goes into csv values and gets managed by Department of Computer Science, JHU (https://www.jhu.edu/)

## Recovered cases showing 0

**JHU (our main data provider) [no longer provides data for amount of recoveries](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/1250), and as a result, the API will be showing 0 for this statistic. Apolegies for any inconvenience. Hopefully we'll be able to find an alternative data-source that offers this.**

## Available data-sources:

Currently 2 different data-sources are available to retrieve the data:

* **jhu** - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 - Worldwide Data repository operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). 

* **csbs** - https://www.csbs.org/information-covid-19-coronavirus - U.S. County data that comes from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.

__jhu__ data-source will be used as a default source if you don't specify a *source parameter* in your request.

## API Reference

All endpoints are located at ``coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/v2/`` and are accessible via https. For instance: you can get data per location by using this URL: 
*[https://coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/v2/locations](https://coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/v2/locations)*

You can open the URL in your browser to further inspect the response. Or you can make this curl call in your terminal to see the prettified response:

```
curl https://coronavirus-tracker-api.herokuapp.com/v2/locations | json_pp
```

### Swagger/OpenAPI
